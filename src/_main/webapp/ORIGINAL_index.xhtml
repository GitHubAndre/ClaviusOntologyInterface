                    <li><b>The Resource</b></li>
                    <ul><li>A diachronic termino-ontological resource, named <i>CLAVIUS</i>, representing the evolution of astronomical 
                            concepts and theories from antiquity until the dawn of the modern age. </li>
                        <li><i>CLAVIUS</i> is being built within the Project <a href="http://claviusontheweb.it/">Clavius on the Web</a> and got its name from Cristophorus Clavius, 
                            a German Jesuit mathematician and astronomer, who was one of the most respected and influential scholars of his time.</li>
                        <li>At the moment the resource is composed of 24 concepts and 82 terms.</li>
                        <li>The resource is still being populated.</li>

                    <li><b>The System (Click the lens icon on the upper toolbar)</b>  </li>
                    <ul><li>In order to make <i>CLAVIUS</i> accessible, a first preliminary version of a controlled natural language interface has been developed for querying the ontology.</li>
                        <li>Researches could be performed by taking into account the lexical level, the ontological level or both.</li>
                        <li>Queries templates were created in order to perform different types of interrogations, 
                            using some menus inside each template.</li>
                        <li>Each template is made of a 
                            fixed part that typify a specific querying model and a variable part that allows the user to
                            chose a certain element of the ontology from the drop-down list.</li>
                        <li>Question templates are 
                            processed by the software into SPARQL queries aimed at interrogating the ontology, 
                            providing the user with the desired answers.</li>
                        <li>The provided answers take into account the diachronic evolution of concepts and properties.</li>
                        <li>Answers are be given both in a tabular form and by means of a timeline.</li>
